# Admongrel Recruitment Task

In this assignment, I develop a Content Management System for different media.

## Disclosure
Generative AI hsa been used to generate fake data to populate the datastores, purely for demonstration purposes. 

## Choices of frameworks and libraries:
- **TanStack Router** (React framework) for front-end routing. Chosen as it supports file-based routing and would integrate well with TanStack Query if I end up needing to use it.
    > TanStack Router uses **Vite** for bundling.
- **Zustand** for state management. Chosen as it has a relatively simple API, especially compared to redux.
  > Some state, e.g. search and filter, will be managed as query parameters in the URL. This way, if a user shares a link, the options affecting the view will be preserved.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling.
- **Hono** for backend API. It has a similar API to express, however, it's more lightweight and only uses Web Standard APIs, meaning it can be deployed on various platforms (e.g. as a serverless function on Cloudflare Workers), without the need for compatibility with Node-specific APIs.
- **Zod** for schema validation. It allows for creating a schema, from which a TypeScript type can be inferred, and the schema can be used to validate data.

## Remarks

- As I am using an in-memory data store, I need to perform manual validation in some places. E.g. I'm having to manually check that genres exist when creating a media item using the `validateGenreId` function.
- I make use of Tanstack Router's route data loader. This has built-in caching, which supports a `stale-while-revalidate` strategy.

## Project structure

This project comprises of three packagesâ€” `api`, a Hono application which simulates API endpoints; `frontend` which is based on Tanstack Router; and `shared` which contains zod-based schemas (and inferred types) that are shared between the front and backend (end-to-end type safety).

## Running the project

To run the required components, run `npm run dev` within the `api` and `frontend` directories. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Areas for future development

In this section, I discuss what I would have done differently, if this was a production project.

### Overall architecture decisions
- Implemented a database, instead of in-memory data stores.
- **Local-first framework** like Zerosync (in development/alpha), Triplit, Powersync, etc. Frameworks like this allow for optimistic updates and server sync (useful in collaborative applications). Though similar behaviour is already possible, e.g. using Tanstack Query  (see [docs re: optimistic update on mutation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/optimistic-updates)), such frameworks also enable real-time updates across multiple clients and offline support.
- **Federated authentication** via OAuth or SAML protocol, where relevant.
- Might consider implementing a state machine to handle media status (e.g. draft, published, deleted, etc.) using something like XState.

### Security
Depending on the requirements of the project, I may consider a mature, off-the-shelf authentication service (like Clerk), or an open-source platform like Ory Kratos.

I would implement a permissions system, either RBAC or ACL-based, to control who can access and modify data.

To prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in some flows (e.g. approvals), I would implement a synchronizer token pattern.

Additionally, I would not avoid storing media on the application server. I would either integrate with a cloud storage provider (like AWS S3) or decouple file storage into a separate service, where I would specifically focus on preventing arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.
